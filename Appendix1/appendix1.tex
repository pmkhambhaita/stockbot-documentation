\chapter{Flowcharts in Mermaid}

This appendix is for the flowcharts used in the documentation. I used Mermaid, a flowchart programming language, to make my flowcharts clearer. Since the images in my documentation are screenshots, I have attached the code I used to create those flowcharts, which can be run on an online Mermaid editor: click {\href{https://mermaid.live}{here} for Mermaid Live.
